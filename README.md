# Problem statement

Airbnb has transformed the travel industry by offering unique and personalized accommodation experiences since 2008. With millions of listings worldwide, the platform generates a wealth of data that provides valuable insights into customer behavior, pricing strategies, and host performance. In a competitive market like New York City, understanding these trends is essential for making informed decisions that benefit both Airbnb and its users.

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb’s 2019 booking data for New York City, with the goal of identifying the key factors that influence customer preferences, pricing dynamics, and booking trends. By uncovering these insights, the aim is to empower Airbnb to optimize its pricing strategies, enhance listing performance, and ultimately improve the experience for both hosts and guests in one of its most competitive markets.

# Problem summary
The purpose of this project was to analyze factors influencing Airbnb prices in New York City and identify patterns across various variables. The insights derived aim to provide valuable information for both travelers and hosts while offering actionable recommendations for improving Airbnb business strategies.

The analysis began with exploring and cleaning the dataset to ensure it was ready for accurate and meaningful analysis. During the data exploration phase, we examined the dataset’s structure, analyzed data types, identified missing values, and studied variable distributions. The data cleaning process addressed inconsistencies, such as missing values, duplicate records, and outliers, ensuring the dataset was high-quality and free from potential biases or errors. This preparation phase laid a solid foundation for the subsequent analysis.

Once the data was prepared, we analyzed and summarized it, focusing on creating visualizations to uncover patterns and trends. By developing graphs and charts, we identified key relationships between variables and gained deeper insights into the data. For example, the analysis revealed that factors such as the minimum nights required, the number of reviews, and the host’s listing count play a significant role in determining prices. Additionally, we observed that pricing and availability vary greatly across neighborhoods, reflecting unique characteristics of each area.

The insights gained through this process highlight important pricing and availability trends, providing valuable information for travelers planning their trips, hosts optimizing their listings, and Airbnb refining its platform. These findings not only enhance decision-making but also contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of the Airbnb market in New York City.
